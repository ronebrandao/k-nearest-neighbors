# k-nearest-neighbors

This is a implementation of the knn algorithm and was done for studying purposes. The data source is composed of 569 instances of breast cells (with and without cancer) features.

The original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/italojs/knn/blob/for-dummies/main.go)
